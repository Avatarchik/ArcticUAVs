The Arctic Unmanned Aerial Vehicle mobile Game App aims to inspire interest about real science and research opportunities in Alaska. Arctic UAVs is a series of missions abstractly based on real research missions executed by the Alaska ACUASI program. Before, during, or after successfully completing a mission, the player can access links to the FrontierScientists.com website hosting videos with scientists describing the real UAV missions. Expect to Fly in the Aleutian Islands, along the Beaufort Sea Ice, and in Kachemak Bay with Otters. It's Challenging but Fun!
