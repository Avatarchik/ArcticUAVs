Youtube Video Player

"""Important in player settings set the Api Compatibility Level to .NET 2.0"""

How it works:
You need to pass the youtube video id or the youtube url and the system returns the video .mp4 file. 
You can call the unity3D Handheld.PlayFullScreenMovie to play your video in fullscreen.
In older version a third party server are needed, on this version you dont need this anymore :)

1080p videos dont have audio atached (youtube thing), for next version i'm developing one feature, to download the video and convert to a new video with audio.(almost done)
(AND THE MOST REQUESTED WINDOWS SUPPORT (ALMOST DONE!!));

Class Usage:
the Handheld.PlayFullScreenMovie play mobile videos *only on mobile device, not works on editor
YoutubeVideo.Instance.RequestVideo is everithing you need to get the video, this function returns the .mp4


Example Scene:
If you want to play the video on textures, just like a outdor(example) in game or a 360 degree video(using a sphere scene of Easy Movie Texture) you need a third part asset, Easy Movie Texture works perfectly with that plugin, if you have Easy Movie Texture take a look at YoutubeEasyMovieTexture script
I think you can do that using a free plugin too, not tested yet but you can try to use vuforia to play video as texture.


EASY MOVIE TEXTURE:
You can add the youtube video as texture using the Easy Movie Texture.
Added one example script "YoutubeEasyMovieTexture.cs" you can just leave the MediaPlayerCtrl component video variable clear and add the YoutubeEasyMovieTexture.cs
to the same game object, add the youtube video id on the variable space and try to run on your mobile device.
If you want to set 360 degree video use the sphere scene of Easy Movie Texture and use a video id of one 360 degree video.
