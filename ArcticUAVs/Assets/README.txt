Project Desciption: The Arctic Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) mobile app game is intended to inspire interest about real science and research 
                    opportunities in Alaska.  The Arctic UAVs game is a series of missions abstractly based on real missions executed by the ACUASI 
                    program. While playing a mission, the player can access links to videos explaining the scientific motivation for the real UAV mission.
